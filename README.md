The idacortex-m-hwreg is a great IDA Pro plugin for getting enhanced analysis capabilities for STM32 microcontrollers. Hereâ€™s how to set it up: 
1. Load your binary file into IDA Pro. 
2. Set the compiler type to GNU C.
3. Import the structs.h file by going to File -> Load File -> Parse C header file.
4. Synchronize the types by going to View -> Open Subviews -> Local types, then Edit -> Synchronize to IDB.
5. Run the stm32f2xx.idc script by going to File -> Script File. This automates segment creation and structure assignment for STM32F2xx hardware registers.
6. Verify that everything was set up correctly by checking the Structures subview for newly defined register structures.
